Affective Priming Experiment: Biobehavioral Study

This repository contains the code and resources required to implement the affective priming experiment, as described in the protocol "Biobehavioral Study of Affective Priming and Its Relationship with Emotional Dysregulation". The experiment is part of a research project conducted at the Neuroscience and Experimental Psychology Laboratory of Universidad del Salvador (USAL).
Experiment Description

The experiment aims to investigate the relationship between difficulties in emotional regulation and the effect of affective priming in emotion recognition tasks. Stimuli include emotional words (emotional labels and activating words) and faces with emotional expressions. Recorded data include response times (RT), accuracy, and physiological measures (electroencephalography and skin conductance).
Features

    Paradigm: Affective priming with congruent and incongruent stimuli.
    Stimuli:
        Emotional words categorized by valence and arousal.
        Faces with emotional expressions from the KDEF dataset.
